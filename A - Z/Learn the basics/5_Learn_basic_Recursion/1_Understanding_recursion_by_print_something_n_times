what is recursion?
recursion is defined as the process which call itself directly or indirectly , by breaking it down into smaller sub problems until it reaches a base case that stops further calls and the corresponding function is called recusrive function

what is stack overflow in recursion?
whenever the recursion calls are executed, they're simultaneously stored in the secursion stack where they wait for the completion of the recursive function. A recursive function can only be computed if a base condition is fullfilled and the control returns to the parent function.
But when there are no base condition given for particular recursive function, it gets called indefinitely which reults in a stack overflow i.e exceeding the memory limit of the recursion stack and hence the program terminates giving a segmentation fault error.

Base conditon
It is the conditon that is sriiten in a recursive function in order for it to get completed and not to run indefinately. after encountering the base condtion, the function terminated and returns back ti its parent funtion simultaneously.

Recursive Tree
A recursive tree is basically a representative form of recursion which depicts how function are called and returned as a seried of events happening consecutively. It is a pictorial description of the process of recursion.

Advantaged of recursion
simplified code
natural reprenstation
reduce code complexity
useful in devide and conquer algorithms

Disadvantages of recursion
High memory usage
Risk of stack overflow
slower execution
harder to debug
